### quick select
* similar to quick sort, but usually no need to sort the whole list/array 
* a portion can be discarded as we know it for sure won't be relevant to the result

### binary search
* find a partition so that the wanting target can fit in one of the partitions
* use the same algorithm to further partition of previous partitions
* till the wanting target is selected
