Dynamic programming helps to efficiently solve problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties. The idea behind dynamic programming is to break the problem into smaller sub-problems and save the result for future use, thus eliminating the need to compute the result repeatedly.

There are two approaches to formulate a dynamic programming solution:

Top-Down Approach:  This approach follows the memoization technique. It consists of recursion and caching. In computation, recursion represents the process of calling functions repeatedly, whereas cache refers to the process of storing intermediate results.

Bottom-Up Approach: This approach uses the tabulation technique to implement the dynamic programming solution. It addresses the same problems as before, but without recursion. In this approach, iteration replaces recursion. Hence, there is no stack overflow error or overhead of recursive procedures.
